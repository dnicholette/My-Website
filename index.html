<h1>About Me</h1>

<p><img src="dom.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="left">Dominique Mercado works for Bobcat Promotions as their content provider who handles Grins social media accounts. She also writes new and press releases for clients. Mercado recently became a member of Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA). She is also interning with a non-profit animal advocacy group, Jusani Culture, as their social media creative content provider to build public relations.</p>
<p> Mercado is a senior on the dean's list at <a href="http://www.txstate.edu" target="_blank">Texas State University</a> majoring in public relations and minoring in communication studies. She will graduate from Texas State in May 2015. After graduation, Mercado hopes to continue working with social media for various companies. Eventually, she wants to make her way into the special events area of public relations. Mercado is currently pursuing internships in the event planning field.</p>
<p>Website development is another area of interest for Mercado. Her recent website development and media design courses have inspired her to continue studying advanced website publishing to add as a special skill in her future.

<p>Before moving to San Marcos, Mercado lived in a small town called La Porte. It is a town right outside of Houston, Texas. Mercado was involved in dance throughout her childhood. She was a part of her high school drill team, The Chatos. She was chosen to be a dancer in three of her school musicals. Mercado was one of the 14 girls that were chosen out of over 50 contestants. The musicals she danced in were White Christmas, The Music Man and Anything Goes.</p>
<p>In her spare time, Mercado enjoys trying different restaurants and foods at the multitude of unique restaurants in the San Marcos area. Root Cellar and Taproom still hold the top two spots for her thus far. Other places she still enjoys are Bobcat Nation, Grins, Valentino's, Sean Patricks and Railyard.</p>
<p>Mercado loves dogs and owns one beagle mix named, Maverick. He is way too smart and way too stubborn. He knows how to sit, crawl, lay, roll over, play dead, close the door and speak (barks not real words). His body is awkwardly long compared to his abnormally short legs. Even though his body is not ideal for swimming, he loves it. Trips to the San Marcos River are a norm for her and this pup.</p>
<p>Netflix is a gift from the world to Mercado and she loves watching funny TV shows. Comedy is her preference. Her favorite shows are The Office, The League, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, The New Girl, 30 Rock, Orange Is The New Black and How I Met Your Mother. The Office ending was one of the saddest times in her life and she wishes it could have gone on for her entire lifetime.</p>
<p>After graduating, Mercado plans on taking a year to travel to some of the places she has always wanted to visit. The places at the top of the travel list are Greece, Turkey, Spain and Paris. Places in the U.S. she would like to visit are New York, Florida, California and Washington D.C..</p>
